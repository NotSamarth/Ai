Q1) What is the time complexity of the Water Jug problem?
->  The time complexity of solving the Water Jug problem depends on the approach used.

1. Brute Force: If we consider a brute force approach where we explore all possible states
   of the jugs until we find the solution, the time complexity can be quite high. Since 
   there can be at most \( O(m \times n) \) states (where \( m \) and \( n \) are the 
   capacities of the jugs), and at each state, we have several possible actions (filling,
   emptying, pouring), the time complexity can be exponential. Specifically, it can be
   represented as \( O((mn)^d) \), where \( d \) is the depth of the search tree, which
   can be at most \( O(m \times n) \) in the worst case.

2. Optimized Approaches (such as BFS or DFS with memoization): 
   By using optimized search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search
   (DFS) with memoization to avoid revisiting the same states, we can significantly reduce the 
   time complexity. These approaches typically have a time complexity of \( O(m \times n) \) or
   \( O(m + n) \) because they explore only the reachable states and avoid redundant exploration.

Therefore, the time complexity of the Water Jug problem can range from exponential to polynomial, 
depending on the approach used.

Q2) Why is DFS not used for solving a water jug problem?
->  DFS has some drawbacks that make it less preferable compared to other algorithms like 
Breadth-First Search (BFS) or even DFS with memoization (also known as Depth-First Search with 
backtracking).

Reasons why DFS might not be the best choice for solving the Water Jug problem:

1. Completeness:DFS may not guarantee completeness, meaning it may not find a solution if one exists.
   This is because DFS can get stuck in an infinite loop if the search space is infinite or if there 
   are cycles in the state transition graph.

2. Optimality:Even if DFS finds a solution, it may not be the shortest or optimal solution. DFS does 
   not explore all possible states at a given depth level before moving to the next level, so it might
   find a solution that is farther from the initial state compared to a shorter solution that BFS would find.

3. Space Complexity: DFS can have a high space complexity, especially if the search tree is deep or if
   there are many possible states. DFS stores the entire path from the root to the current node in memory,
   which can lead to high memory usage.

4. Performance:DFS may take longer to find a solution compared to BFS or other optimized search algorithms,
   especially in cases where the optimal solution is closer to the initial state.

While DFS can still be used to solve the Water Jug problem, it may not be the most efficient or effective 
choice in terms of completeness, optimality, space complexity, and performance. Therefore, other algorithms 
like BFS or DFS with memoization are often preferred for solving this problem.
